# Lazy-Typeface-Decision-Maker
This is a typeface decision maker for lazy graphic designers.<br>

![](Images/Lazy%20Typeface%20Decision%20Maker.png)

It reads all of your typefaces in your library. <br>
It's going to be updated with different choices in the future to make publications automated and randomized: <br>
Numbers of columns, the place where page numbers are, margins... <br>
Any suggestions are welcome.<br><br>
